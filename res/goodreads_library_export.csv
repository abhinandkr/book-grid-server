She OD's and ends up in The Midnight Library where she is given a chance to live out other versions of her life by a mystical librarian from her past, the various books representing the alternate realities. It was rather nice to see how she sees herself in various other lives, each of them representing a desire, a ""what would have been."" However, the one thing that made me roll my eyes a bit is that after noticing something small or large not according to her expectations, she quickly grows weary of the life and heads back to the library, almost as if the chapter is being quickly ended by the author (this is my imagination and is not featured in the novel). Also, the various references to quasi-science of quantum universes felt unnecessary. <br/><br/>The novel redeemed itself in the third act where Nora goes to a seemingly perfect life, and understands how much impact she has had on everyone by the doing (or the lack of doing) of a certain thing, big or small. The protagonist almost becomes incidental to the narration as the author inserts a lot of life lessons, that actually read quite well and don't come across as hackneyed. Finally, Nora ultimately goes back to her life and all is well!<br/><br/>Almost well. Since this is a semi sci-fi novel, I wished the cat would return; just as the only change in her old life, a small gift from the librarian perhaps.",true,,1,0
